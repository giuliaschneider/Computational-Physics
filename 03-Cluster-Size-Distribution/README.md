## Cluster size distribution

In this exercise, the cluster size distribution of a percolation model was calculated using the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm for a square lattice. The algorithm calculates the cluster size distribution efficiently by iterating through the lattice once while checking the northern and eastern neighbor of each site.
