Finding a minima or a maxima of a function <em>F(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>)</em> is equivalent to finding the root of its derivative, i.e. <em>f(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>) = &nabla; F(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>) = 0</em>. In this exercise, the Newton's and the Secant methods for root finding were implemented and tested for different initial values.
