Random walks are stochastic processes which are characterized by a random sequence of steps. They are used to simulate various phenomenon in physics, chemistry, finance as for example Brownian motion, diffusion and the transport of pollutants. In this exercise, simple and self avoiding random walks with fixed step size are implemented in 2D/3D continuous space.
