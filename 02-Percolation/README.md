## Percolation

Percolation models are used to simulate so called critical phenomena in many different applications. In this exercise, the Burning Method was implemented to simulated percolation on a square grid. The simulation was evaluated based on the probability of findeing a percolative cluster, the average shortest path and the average life time.
