## Monte Carlo Integration

Monte Carlo methods are more efficient than conventional quadrature rules in calculating higher dimensional integrals. The error of Monte Carlo Integration scales with the number of sample points as *N*<sup>-1/2</sup> and is thus independent of the dimension.

In this exercise, the mean distance between *n* spheres averaged over all configurations in a square box of size *L*<sup>3</sup> was calculated using Monte Carlo Integration. The convergence of the results with increasing number of configurations and number of spheres was investigated.
